<h1><b>Twenty-First Century Edition of the Goodhue-Veino Genealogy</b></h1>
<h2>Updated to cover the following 8 twentieth century lines: Orth, Wight, Sewell, Pooler, West, Hatfield, Goodhue, and Veino.</h2>
<p>The idea (as of January 2015) is both to expand the content of the original and also, by digitizing, make archiving and retrieval easier.</p>
<br>
<h3><u>Original Foreward:</u></h3>
<p>This work represents the first draft of an attempt to work out the genealogical lines of our children. It is the result of the first year's research along this line and is far from complete and, we hope, to be greatly augmented within a short time. It represents the results of a portion of a considerable amount of labor which, however, has been extremely interesting and has served as a hobby of considerable value to us.</p>
<p>The information herein is made up of a main section and a number of appendices; the main section gives the lines as determined and the appendices give lists of immigrant women, incomplete lines, probable lines, maps, charts and information on the writing of dates in Colonial days.</p>
<p>We can only hope that this will be of some interest to you.</p>
